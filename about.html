                <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>
                        Simon Cerezo is an interactive/game design major of Filipino descent, 
                        from San Jose, California. He is an aspiring game designer, mainly 
                        focusing on map/level design. <br> Growing up, he has always been a fan 
                        of video games, particularly games that allow the players to explore 
                        the environments around them. As a little boy, one of Simonâ€™s <br> earliest 
                        memories would be that of his siblings playing video games on the two 
                        consoles we owned at the time, the Sega Dreamcast and the Sony 
                        Playstation 1. The games <br> that his siblings would play contained, 
                        what was considered during their time, large-scale maps. 
                        While watching them play these games, it sparked something in 
                        a young Simon. <br> It sparked his interest in games as well as his 
                        eagerness for personal customization, in hopes that someday he might 
                        possibly develop something similar in scale in the future.
